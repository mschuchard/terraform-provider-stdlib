# function: count

Return the number of non-overlapping instances of a substring in a string. The substring cannot be empty as this counts the number of Unicode code points in the string (before and after each rune), and this is awkward within Terraform.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Return the substring count of a string:
provider::stdlib::count("pizza", "z")
# result => 2
```

## Signature

<!-- signature generated by tfplugindocs -->
```text
count(string string, substring string) number
```

## Arguments

<!-- arguments generated by tfplugindocs -->
1. `string` (String) Input string parameter for determining the number of occurrences of the substrings within it.
1. `substring` (String) Input substring parameter for determining the number of occurrences of that substring in a string.
