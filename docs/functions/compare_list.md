  Compare the elements of two lists similar to the spaceship operator

# function: compare_list

Returns a comparison between two lists. The elements are compared sequentially, starting at index 0, until one element is not equal to the other. The result of comparing the first non-matching elements is returned. If both lists are equal until one of them ends, then the shorter list is considered less than the longer one. The result is 0 if list_one == list_two, -1 if list_one < list_two, and +1 if list_one > list_two. The input lists must be single-level.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Returns a comparison between two lists (final element of first list is less than final element of second list):
provider::stdlib::compare_list(["foo", "bar", "b"], ["foo", "bar", "baz"])
# result => -1

# Returns a comparison between two lists (lists are equal):
provider::stdlib::compare_list(["pizza", "cake"], ["pizza", "cake"])
# result => 0

# Returns a comparison between two lists (second element of first list is greater than second element of second list):
provider::stdlib::compare_list(["super", "hyper", "turbo"], ["pizza", "cake", "punch"])
# result => 1

# Returns a comparison between two lists (lists are equal until first list has more elements):
provider::stdlib::compare_list(["pizza", "cake", "punch"], ["pizza", "cake"])
# result => 1
```
