# function: elements_delete

Return the list where values are deleted beginning and ending inclusively at two specific element indices. This function errors if the `end_index` is out of range for the original list (greater than or equal to the length of the `list` parameter).

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Delete the elements of a list from 0 to 1 inclusive:
provider::stdlib::elements_delete(["zero", "one", "two", "three"], 0, 1)
# result => ["two", "three"]

# Delete the elements of a list from 2 to 3 inclusive:
provider::stdlib::elements_delete(["zero", "one", "two", "three"], 2, 3)
# result => ["zero", "one"]
```
